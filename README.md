# Excercise-Machine-Learning
There are tutorials for the machine learning exam in this repository.

the first exercise is on decision trees: the goal is to build a classifier based on decision trees, which after training on the Iris dataset, produces a confusion matrix on 3 different labels. to evaluate the results various tests were carried out, varying the depth of the search and the number of minimum nodes generated.

the second exercise is on the K-nn algorithm: the goal is to compare the prediction results obtained from the decision trees and the nearest k-neighbors on the Iris data set.

the third exercise is on the K-means and DB-scan algorithm: the goal is to determine if the two algorithms with statistical metrics obtain a good quantitative evaluation of the clusters in the three different datasets.

the fourth exercise is on the Naive bayes method: the goal is to compare two models for probabilistic modeling of categorical data: Bernoulli multivariate and multinomial on a data set. We adopt a dataset on Twitter messages tagged with emotions (Joy vs Sadness). for the evaluation, the accuracy was calculated with the use of some statistical tests
